                         In terms of my interests, I have explored various pursuits: writing, playing piano, drawing, learning Korean, playing strategy games and puzzles (Chess, Yu-Gi-Oh!), and even more! <br/>
                          This diverse exploration has led me to realize that my genuine passion lies in exploring uncharted territories. My curiosity has no limits, and I am unafraid to venture into the unknown.
                         <br/>
                         If I were to describe myself, I would say I am a person with a strong interest in science and technology, a passion for art and creativity, and a playful and joyful attitude towards life.
                         Through my experience with these activities, I've learned the value of dedication and a meticulous approach, qualities that are essential for venturing into the unknown and making discoveries in any field
